# image-collection
A collection of some images i've created with [Ti*k*Z](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/pgf). It should be growing in the future and may be constantly work in progress.

## A Preview

The pre-compiled pdf my be found [here](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/EagleoutIce/image-collection/gh-pages/the-collection.pdf) or [here](https://github.com/EagleoutIce/image-collection/blob/gh-pages/the-collection.pdf).

## Color-Palette

I wrote a [color-palette](https://github.com/EagleoutIce/color-palettes)-package which is used in this collection but you do not need it for the graphics. Just exchange all the `shade*` and `palette*`-colors with the color of your choice.

All other (global) definitions are located in the [image-base.sty](image-base.sty)-File.
